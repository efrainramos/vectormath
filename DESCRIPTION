Description: This package aims to provide the cross product or dot product of 2 3D vectors. A 3D vector is a line segment that exist in the 3D space. 
    3D vectors are often denoted by <i,j,k> or <x,y,z>. 
    The cross product of 2 3D vectors is another 3D vector. The dot product of 2 3D vectors is a scalar, a number.
    This package will work by taking in 2 3D vectors <i,j,k>, or a vector with 3 values, and returns either a scalar,vector, or a 3D plot.
    The function also finds the magnitude of a 3D vector.
