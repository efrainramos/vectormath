# vectormath
This package does calcluations using 3D vectors. 3D vectors are commonly written in the form <i,j,k>. In R I decided to use a vector of length 3 to represent my 3D vector. For example,
the 3D vector <1,2,3> is represented by an R vector c(1,2,3). These calculations are commonly used in Calculus 3, so Calc 3 students can benefit from using this package to help visualize
how vectors work in 3D space.

#testing my package
In the repo, there is a testscript.R file that you can download to help you run the different functions I created. There is no data file in my package because I did not use any data for analyzation.
The data needed to run my package is data that is given on a HW assignment or textbook.
